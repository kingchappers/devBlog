I've used Python for a few years now. It's a convenient high-level language to things done with and a great tool to have in your toolbox. 


### Black Hat Python
I've been going through the Black Hat Python book by Justin Seitz to help me learn more about the language and the things you can do with it. It's supposedly really good for penetration testing as a lot of systems have it installed by default therefore making it readily available. In my experience, if an organisation has looked into their own cyber hygene they'll be removing programs and applications they're not using which would make this more difficult; there are likely some organisations that aren't doing this though, so it can still come in handy.

As it 2021 I've been using Python 3 which makes things a little harder as the programs in the book use 2.7 so there are some discrepencies. This has made it a little difficult in some areas, some of the conversion is really easy but some of it takes some good search engine use.

If you'd like to see the work I've done it's all up on my Gihub <a href="https://github.com/kingchappers/blackHatPython" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.
