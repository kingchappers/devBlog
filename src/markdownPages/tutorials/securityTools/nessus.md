Nessus is one of the industries most well know vulnerability scanners, there are plenty of others out there but this one is one that I've used most. Vulnerability scanners are great for detecting whether a system/network is vulnerable to 'known' vulnerabilities. This isn't about zero-days, which is what the industry reports most on. Generally attacks are performed because a system is not up to date with the latest patches, it has been misconfigured, or it is using default credentials; this is why it's important too know where your vulnerabilities are.

You can download and install Nessus from the Tenable website. This is a paid for solution normally used by enterprises or vulnerability management organisations, but you can utilise Nessus Essentials to test with. Nessus Essentials is a version specifically designed to use to test out the tool and is therefore limited in the number of nodes it can scan but for your own personal use it's ideal. If your setting up for the first time, the process is pretty self explanatory, however, it does take a while for it to fully install.
